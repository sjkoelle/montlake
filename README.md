# montlake ðŸ›¶
Welcome to montlake.
Montlake contains tools for geometric data analysis.
It includes vector field group lasso and basis pursuit methods for parametric manifold learning.
It also contains differentiable shape featurizations including interpoint distances, planar angles, and torsions from data positions.
It uses embedding and tangent estimation components of the megaman package.

# Installation

```
conda create -n 'montlake' python=3.6
conda activate montlake
conda install --channel=conda-forge -y pip nose coverage cython numpy scipy scikit-learn pyflann pyamg h5py plotly
pip install git+git://github.com/sjkoelle/montlake/
```

# Usage

Code from the experiments folder can be used recreate results from Manifold Coordinates with Physical Meaning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11891).
Individual analyses are parameterized in experiments/configs and can be called from the command line.

```
python -m montlake.exec.run_exp --config montlake/experiments/configs/malonaldehyde_full.json
```

This will save a dictionary with relevant experimental results.  These results are plotted in experiments/nbs.

# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute, branch, fork, or edit.
This package was built using nbdev, and so source code is kept in the nbs folder and then compiled by running nbdev_build_lib.
