# montlake ðŸ›¶
Welcome to Montlake: tools for geometric data analysis.
It contains group lasso and basis pursuit algorithms for parametric manifold learning and interfacing code for computing interpoint distances, planar angles, and torsions.

# Installation

```
conda create -n 'montlake' python=3.6
conda activate montlake
conda install --channel=conda-forge -y pip nose coverage cython numpy scipy scikit-learn pyflann pyamg h5py plotly
pip install git+git://github.com/sjkoelle/montlake/
```

# Usage

Code from the experiments folder can be used recreate results from Manifold Coordinates with Physical Meaning (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11891).
Individual analyses are parameterized in experiments/configs. Plotting is in experiments/nbs.

# Contributing

Please feel free to contribute, branch, fork, or edit.
This package was built using nbdev, and so source code is kept in the nbs folder and then compiled by running nbdev_build_lib.
